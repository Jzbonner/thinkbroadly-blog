**Design Philosophy**: minimal two section design (top and bottom layers)
* Home Page: top and bottom design for spotlight section and "all articles" section 
* Post Page: top and bottom design where top has a spotlight image and bottom has content
* Privacy Page: one page design minimal content 
* License Page: one page design minimal content

**UI Toolkit**: The UI for high-level components is being managed with ChakraUI and the lower-level UI details are being managed with TailwindCSS.
* ChakraUI: for typography management, overlay sections, feedback sections, layout grids, link management, and basic framer-motion transitions
* TailwindCSS: for custom css driven animations, color/branding palettes, gradients, and detailed component layouts
